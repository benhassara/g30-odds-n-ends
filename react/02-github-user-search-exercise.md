# GitHub User Search w/ React

For this exercise, you'll build an app that searches for a GitHub username, and then displays the user on the page. You must display the following information when a user is successfully found:

1. Username
1. Real Name
1. 5 of the user's repositories.

Before you start writing code, it may be useful for you to look at the mockups below and plan out which aspects of the page you'll create your own React components for. Here's the base endpoint for the GitHub API to use:

```
//api.github.com/users/
```

The mockups:
